# LOFT - Living Off Free Trials

A security research platform documenting services commonly abused for malicious purposes including phishing, malware distribution, command & control, and data exfiltration. This project follows the methodologies of [LOTS Project](https://lots-project.com), [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/), and [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) for defensive security research.

## üåê Live Site

**[Your GitHub Pages URL will be here]**

## üéØ Features

- **Security Research Focus** - Documents abuse potential of legitimate services
- **Expandable Descriptions** - Click platforms to view security research details
- **Advanced Search** - Use `+tag` for tag search, `#category` for category filtering
- **Security Tags** - Phishing, Download, Exfiltration, C&C, SSO, Dev Tier classifications
- **Contributor Attribution** - Shows research contributors in expanded view
- **Clean Table Interface** - Technical design inspired by LOTS/LOLBAS methodology
- **Auto-Updates** - Content automatically syncs from the LOFT repository

## üîç Search Tips

- **General Search**: Type platform name or description
- **Tag Search**: Use `+` prefix (e.g., `+phishing`, `+exfiltration`, `+dev tier`)
- **Category Search**: Use `#` prefix (e.g., `#hosting`, `#communication`)
- **Security Focus**: Search for specific abuse types like `+download` or `+c&c`
- **Clear Search**: Empty the search box to see all platforms

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Stack

- **Static Site** - Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **GitHub Pages** - Automated deployment
- **YAML Pipeline** - Content sourced from structured data
- **Responsive CSS** - Monospace fonts, technical aesthetic

## üìä Data Source

Security research data is automatically generated from the [LOFT Content Repository](../LOFT), which contains:
- Individual YAML files documenting service abuse potential
- Security-focused tags and descriptions (Phishing, Download, Exfiltration, C&C, SSO, Dev Tier)
- Contributor attribution and research metadata
- Automated processing and validation pipeline
- Fallback data ensures site functionality without processed JSON

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Research Ethics

**This project is for defensive security research and education only.**

- **Legitimate Services**: We document abuse of legitimate platforms, not malicious services
- **Defensive Purpose**: Content is designed to help security professionals understand threats
- **No Exploitation**: We do not provide attack tools or specific exploitation methods
- **Responsible Research**: All research follows ethical security research practices
- **Awareness Building**: Goal is to improve security awareness and defensive measures

## üé® Design Philosophy

- **Information Dense** - Maximum security research data in minimal space
- **Technical Aesthetic** - Monospace fonts, clean lines inspired by LOTS/LOLBAS
- **Research Focused** - Optimized for security researchers and blue teams
- **Mobile Optimized** - Responsive table design for field research
